* Experience: pattern matching
* Focus: actual time VS hypothetical time
* Design sacrifice: killing 5% to get 90%
* Simplicity
* Perfectionism, or how to kill your productivity and bias your designs
* Knowledge: some theory is going to help

* Always maintain constantly shippable code.
* Keep your code absolutely simple.
* Spend time simplifying code.
    * Spend as much time on tools as possible.
    * Don’t waste others’ time. Test thoroughly before checking in your code.
    * As soon as you see a bug, you fix it.
* Write your code for this game only - not for a future game. 
* Encapsulate functionality to ensure design consistency
* Try to code transparently.
* Every programmer is different and will code differently. (Respect differences and focus on the results.)
